# SimonSaysGame

This project is an IoT system that implements Simon Says game that has single player mode or player vs. player mode.  Each player will use a 4x4 keypad to interact. When the game start, player 1's keypad will have LED 0 flashes once, this indicates the game has started. Player 1 needs to press LED 0 first, then press any key on the keypad. After the keys are pressed, it will be sent to player 2. The keys combination that are pressed by player 1 will then be shown on player 2's key pad. After the combination is shown, player 2 needs to follow the combination shown earlier and press one extra key on the keypad. The key combination will then be sent back to player1. The game is like this going back and forth until one player cannot follow the correct key combination.
